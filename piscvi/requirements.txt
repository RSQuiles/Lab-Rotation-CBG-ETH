# piscVI Environment Requirements
# ================================
# Core dependencies for running the pathway-informed scVI (piscVI) model

# Core Scientific Computing
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0
scipy>=1.7.0

# Deep Learning Framework
torch>=2.0.0
lightning>=2.0.0  # PyTorch Lightning

# Single-cell Analysis
scanpy>=1.9.0
anndata>=0.8.0
scvi-tools>=1.0.0  # Main framework - provides scVI implementation and utilities

# Machine Learning & Metrics
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
scib-metrics>=0.5.0  # Single-cell integration benchmarking metrics

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.5.0
seaborn>=0.11.0
plottable>=0.1.5  # For table visualizations in benchmarking

# Nearest Neighbors
pynndescent>=0.5.8  # Fast nearest neighbor search

# Utilities
tqdm>=4.62.0  # Progress bars

# Optional but Recommended
# ========================
# For GPU acceleration (if available)
# torch with CUDA support - install separately based on your CUDA version
# See: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

# Development Dependencies (optional)
# ===================================
# jupyter>=1.0.0
# ipykernel>=6.0.0
# black>=22.0.0  # Code formatting
# pytest>=7.0.0  # Testing

# Notes:
# ------
# 1. scvi-tools is the main dependency and will pull in many of the above packages
# 2. For CUDA/GPU support, install PyTorch with the appropriate CUDA version first
# 3. Some packages may require specific versions depending on your scvi-tools version
# 4. The custom scib_core_gmm.py and scib_nmi_ari_gmm.py modules are included in src/
#    and provide GMM-based clustering metrics not in standard scib-metrics
